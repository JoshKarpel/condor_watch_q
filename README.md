# condor_watch_q

An **experimental** HTCondor command line tool for users to look at live job status updates without repeatedly querying the schedd.

Install by running `pip install git+https://github.com/JoshKarpel/condor_watch_q`, or by simply copying `condor_watch_q.py` into your path (with or without the file extension) and making sure you have the HTCondor Python bindings installed.
